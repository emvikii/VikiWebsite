    Private Cloud

 <p>
    A Private Cloud is a model of cloud computing where the infrastructure is dedicated to a single user organization. A private cloud can be hosted either at an organization’s own data center, at a third party colocation facility, or via a private cloud provider who offers private cloud hosting services and may or may not also offer traditional public shared multi-tenant cloud infrastructure.
<br> <br>
Typically, the end-user organization is responsible for the operation of a private cloud as if it were a traditional on-premises infrastructure, which includes ongoing maintenance, upgrades, OS patches, middleware, and application software management.
<br> <br>
Private Cloud Solutions offer organizations more control over and better security of private cloud servers, although it does require a much higher level of IT expertise than utilizing a public cloud.
