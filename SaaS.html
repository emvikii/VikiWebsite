    What is Software-as-a-Service?
</h2>
<p>
    Software as a service (SaaS) is a software delivery model. With SaaS, applications are hosted in the cloud, delivered to customers via the internet, and licensed as subscriptions. Unlike traditional software licensing, SaaS does not require customers to purchase anything upfront or to maintain an application’s underlying infrastructure.
<br> <br>
The software that SaaS delivers is designed, developed, maintained, and billed by its cloud service provider. Meanwhile, a SaaS subscriber can access the application(s) in question as long as they have a compatible client device—often a web browser or dedicated application— and an internet connection.
<br> <br>
SaaS offers straightforward and scalable access to software with minimal overhead for the customer.

Examples of SaaS include customer relationship management (CRM) solutions in the cloud, hosted collaboration platforms for chat and video conferencing, online productivity suites, and expense management software—among many others. All of these provide equivalent or similar functionality to traditionally licensed counterparts, while being easier to manage.

The SaaS model has become the primary mode of consuming software for businesses, and it now represents the single largest segment of the overall cloud computing market. Many organizations have made SaaS adoption central to their cloud migration strategies, as a way of streamlining access to key applications and reducing licensing costs.
