    What is Platform-as-a-Service?
</h2>
<p>
    Platform-as-a-service (PaaS) is a form of cloud computing where an application software platform is provided by another party. Primarily for developers and programmers, a PaaS allows the user to develop, run, and manage their own apps without having to build and maintain the infrastructure or platform usually associated with the process. PaaS platforms can run in the cloud or on on-premise infrastructure. For managed offerings, a PaaS provider hosts the hardware and software on its own infrastructure and delivers this platform to the user as an integrated solution, solution stack, or service through an internet connection.
    For cloud-native development use cases, a Kubernetes-based PaaS can function as the platform on which container-based applications can run, scale, and be managed. For example, the cloud services editions of Red Hat® OpenShift®  are managed PaaS offerings.

    PaaS allows organizations to quickly and confidently develop, deploy, and iterate business applications and integrations without having to purchase and maintain the supporting infrastructure. For smaller businesses, it provides them access to the latest technology without having to make a large up-front investment in resources. Larger enterprises can quickly add new users and resources as business needs evolve while bypassing lengthy procurement processes. And for any size organization, PaaS allows them to focus on their core business activities without having to worry about maintaining and updating basic technology infrastructure.
